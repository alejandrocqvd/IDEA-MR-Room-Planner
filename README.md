# IDEA Mixed Reality Room Planner

Using Unity 6 and Meta's XR SDK, I developed a mixed reality app for the Quest 3 that allows users to visualize and customize their living spaces with life-sized 3D furniture models, in real time. 

The app features advanced hand tracking, giving users the freedom to grab, move, and arrange furniture as they would naturally, without the need for controllers. Users can grab the virtual catalogue panel to view a selection of over 100+ unique pieces, including armchairs, desks, drawers, lamps, bookcases, and sofas. 

This mixed reality experience offers a new way to explore interior design, making it more intuitive in a natural, hands-on way.

### Disclaimer

Due to the large file size of .glb 3D models, a good amount of assets were excluded from this repository.

Also, in the project files you can tell the project was originally called ```PROJECT-MR```, this was before I realized IDEA MR Room Planner was a lot cooler (the logo is from Escape from Tarkov).

## Features

- **Life-Sized 3D Models:** Visualize furniture at true scale within your actual space.
